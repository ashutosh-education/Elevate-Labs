Elevate Labs Internship Tasks 

I cleaned and prepared the raw dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicate rows, and standardizing text fields such as languages. I also converted all date columns to a consistent format and renamed column headers to be uniform (lowercase, no spaces). Finally, I checked and corrected data types to ensure numerical and date fields were in the proper format. The dataset is now clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.
